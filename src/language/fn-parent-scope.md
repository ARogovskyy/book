Call a Function Within the Caller's Scope
========================================

Peeking Out of The Pure Box
---------------------------

```admonish info.side "Only scripts"

This is only meaningful for _scripted_ [functions].

Native Rust functions can never access any [`Scope`].
```

Rhai [functions] are _pure_, meaning that they depend on on their arguments and have no access to
the calling environment.

When a [function] accesses a [variable] that is not defined within that [function]'s [`Scope`],
it raises an evaluation error.

It is possible, through a special syntax, to actually run the [function] call within the [`Scope`]
of the parent caller &ndash; i.e. the [`Scope`] that makes the [function] call &ndash; and
access/mutate [variables] defined there.


```rust,no_run
fn foo(y) {             // function accesses 'x' and 'y', but 'x' is not defined
    x += y;             // 'x' is modified in this function
    let z = 0;          // 'z' is defined in this function's scope
    x
}

let x = 1;              // 'x' is defined here in the parent scope

foo(41);                // error: variable 'x' not found

// Calling a function with a '!' causes it to run within the caller's scope

foo!(41) == 42;         // the function can access and mutate the value of 'x'!

x == 42;                // 'x' is changed!

z == 0;                 // <- error: variable 'z' not found

x.method!();            // <- syntax error: not allowed in method-call style

// Also works for function pointers

let f = Fn("foo");

call!(f, 42) == 84;     // must use function-call style

x == 84;                // 'x' is changed once again

f.call!(41);            // <- syntax error: not allowed in method-call style

// But not allowed for module functions

import "hello" as h;

h::greet!();            // <- syntax error: not allowed in namespace-qualified calls
```

```admonish danger.small "The caller's scope can be mutated"

Changes to [variables] in the calling [`Scope`] persist.

With this syntax, it is possible for a Rhai [function] to mutate its calling environment.
```

```admonish warning.small "New variables are not retained"

[Variables] or [constants] defined within the [function] are _not_ retained.
They remain local to the [function].

Although the syntax resembles a Rust _macro_ invocation, it is still a [function] call.
```


```admonish danger "Caveat emptor"

[Functions] relying on the calling [`Scope`] is often a _Very Bad Ideaâ„¢_ because it makes code
almost impossible to reason about and maintain, as their behaviors are volatile and unpredictable.

Rhai [functions] are normally _pure_, meaning that you can rely on the fact that they never mutate
the outside environment.  Using this syntax breaks this guarantee.

[Functions] called in this manner behave more like macros that are expanded inline than actual
function calls, thus the syntax is also similar to Rust's macro invocations.

This usage should be at the last resort.

**YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED**.
